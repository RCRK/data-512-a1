Human Centered Data Science
The goal of this analysis was to create a monthly traffic on english wikipedia across devices and report the trends. 

Data set used is from Wikipedia
The link to the API which was used to pull the data: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/REST_API#Terms_and_conditions
Data was accessed through two API's 
1. The Legacy Pagecounts API. Documentation: https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Analytics/AQS/Legacy_Pagecounts
2. PageViews API. Documentation: https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Analytics/AQS/Pageviews

I have only created the individual files but not yet able to create the combined file which includes all the data.
